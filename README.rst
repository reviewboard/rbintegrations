Review Board Integrations
=========================

This extends `Review Board`_ 5.0+ with support for integrating with
third-party services, like Slack or automated code review services.

The latest supported version is automatically installed as part of Review
Board 5.0+, but maintained and released separately, allowing administrators to
get the latest and greatest integration support without having to update
Review Board.

Getting Support
===============

We can help you get going with Review Board, and diagnose any issues that may
come up. There are two levels of support: Public community support, and
private premium support.

The public community support is available on our main `discussion list`_. We
generally respond to requests within a couple of days. This support works well
for general, non-urgent questions that don't need to expose confidential
information.

We can also provide more
`dedicated, private support <https://www.beanbaginc.com/support/contracts/>`_
for your organization through a support contract. We offer same-day responses
(generally within a few hours, if not sooner), confidential communications,
installation/upgrade assistance, emergency database repair, phone/chat (by
appointment), priority fixes for urgent bugs, and backports of urgent fixes to
older releases (when possible).
