Integrations 3.0.2 Release Notes
================================

**Release date**: November 1, 2022


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed a (harmless) crash when attempting to publish empty reviews to
  :rbintegration:`Discord <discord>`, :rbintegration:`Slack <slack>`, or
  :rbintegration:`Mattermost <mattermost>`.

  This would cause a crash report in the log file, but otherwise had no
  impact on Review Board or the chat service.
